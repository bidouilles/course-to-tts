What is Rust? Rust is a new programming language which had its one point zero release in two thousand fifteen. Rust is a statically compiled language in a similar role as C++. Rustc uses LLVM as its backend. Rust supports many platforms and architectures, including x86, ARM, and WebAssembly, as well as operating systems like Linux, Mac, and Windows. Rust is used for a wide range of devices, including firmware and boot loaders, smart displays, mobile phones, desktops, and servers. Rust fits in the same area as C++. It offers high flexibility and a high level of control. It can be scaled down to very constrained devices like mobile phones. Rust has no runtime or garbage collection. It focuses on reliability and safety without sacrificing performance.
